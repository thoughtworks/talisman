  Talisman is a tool is to validate code changes that are to be pushed out of a
  local Git repository on a developer's workstation. By hooking into the
  pre-push hook provided by Git, it validates the outgoing changeset for things
  that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens,
  private keys etc. The aim is for Talisman to scan both file names and file
  content so that even potential problems embedded in source code and
  documentation can be caught.
