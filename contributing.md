# Contributing to Talisman

## Developing locally

To contribute to Talisman, you need a working golang development
environment. Check [this link](https://golang.org/doc/install) to help
you get started with that.

Talisman now uses go modules (GO111MODULE=on) to manage dependencies

Once you have go 1.11 installed and setup, clone the talisman repository. In your
working copy, fetch the dependencies by having go mod fetch them for
you.

```` GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor ````

To run tests ```` GO111MODULE=on go test -mod=vendor ./...  ````

To build Talisman, we can use [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox):

```` gox -osarch="darwin/amd64 linux/386 linux/amd64" ````

Convenience scripts ```./build``` and ```./clean``` perform build and clean-up as mentioned above.

## Releasing

* Follow the instructions at the end of 'Developing locally' to build the binaries
* Bump the [version in install.sh](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman/blob/d4b1b1d11137dbb173bf681a03f16183a9d82255/install.sh#L10) according to [semver](https://semver.org/) conventions
* Update the [expected hashes in install.sh](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman/blob/d4b1b1d11137dbb173bf681a03f16183a9d82255/install.sh#L16-L18) to match the new binaries you just created (`shasum -b -a256 ...`)
* Make release commit and tag with the new version prefixed by `v` (like `git tag v0.3.0`)
* Push your release commit and tag: `git push && git push --tags`
* [Create a new release in github](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman/releases/new), filling in the new commit tag you just created
* Update the install script hosted on github pages: `git checkout gh-pages`, `git checkout master -- install.sh`, `git commit -m ...`

The latest version will now be accessible to anyone who builds their own binaries, downloads binaries directly from github releases, or uses the install script from the website.
