# Keep your secrets secret
{: .fs-9 }

Talisman is a tool that installs a hook to your repository to ensure that potential secrets or sensitive information do not leave the developer's workstation.
It validates the outgoing changeset for things that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens, private keys etc.
Talisman can also be used as a repository history scanner to detect secrets that have already been checked in, so that you can take an informed decision to safeguard secrets.
