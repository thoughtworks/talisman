# Global Installation 
Recommended approach of installation
{: .fs-4 .text-yellow-300}

It is a good choice to install Talisman as a global hook template. Talisman will thus be present, not only in your existing git repositories, but also in any new repository that you 'init' or 'clone'.<br>
Although you could choose to install Talisman as pre-commit or a pre-push hook, we recommend installing Talisman as a **pre-commit git hook template**.

Follow the steps below:

1. Run the following command on your terminal, to download and install the binary at $HOME/.talisman/bin
 > As a pre-commit hook:
```
curl --silent  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtworks/talisman/master/global_install_scripts/install.bash > /tmp/install_talisman.bash && /bin/bash /tmp/install_talisman.bash
```
 > OR
 > As a pre-push hook:
  ```
curl --silent  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtworks/talisman/master/global_install_scripts/install.bash > /tmp/install_talisman.bash && /bin/bash /tmp/install_talisman.bash pre-push
```
2. If you do not have `TALISMAN_HOME` set up in your `$PATH`, you will be asked an appropriate place to set it up. Choose the option number where you set the profile source on your machine.
 > _Remember to execute `source` on the path file or restart your terminal._
 > _If you choose to set the `$PATH` later, add `export TALISMAN\_HOME=$HOME/.talisman/bin` to the path._
3. Choose a base directory where Talisman should scan for all git repositories, and setup a git hook (pre-commit or pre-push, as chosen in step 1) as a symlink.
  This script will not clobber pre-existing hooks. If you have existing hooks, look for ways to chain Talisman into them (Check the page on 'Handling Existing Hooks').
