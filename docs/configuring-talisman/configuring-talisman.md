# Configuring Talisman

Talisman comes with its own run configurations, that allow you to configure Talisman in many ways.
You can guide Talisman to ignore from scanning, include in scanning, set severity threshold and much more.

The configurations are driven by `.talismanrc` file which is for the users to create and manage.
The `.talismanrc` file must be created in the root folder of your git project.
